          [ This program prints "Hello World!" and a newline to the screen, its
        length is 106 active command characters. [It is not the shortest.]

        This loop is an "initial comment loop", a simple way of adding a comment
        to a BF program such that you don't have to worry about any command
        characters. Any ".", ",", "+", "-", "<" and ">" characters are simply
        ignored, the "[" and "]" characters just have to be balanced. This
        loop and the commands it contains are ignored because the current cell
        defaults to a value of 0; the 0 value causes this loop to be skipped.
      ]
      ++++++++               Set Cell #0 to 8
      [
          >++++               Add 4 to Cell #1; this will always set Cell #1 to 4
          [                   as the cell will be cleared by the loop
              >++             Add 2 to Cell #2
              >+++            Add 3 to Cell #3
              >+++            Add 3 to Cell #4
              >+              Add 1 to Cell #5
              <<<<-           Decrement the loop counter in Cell #1
          ]                   Loop till Cell #1 is zero; number of iterations is 4
          >+                  Add 1 to Cell #2
          >+                  Add 1 to Cell #3
          >-                  Subtract 1 from Cell #4
          >>+                 Add 1 to Cell #6
          [<]                 Move back to the first zero cell you find; this will
                              be Cell #1 which was cleared by the previous loop
          <-                  Decrement the loop Counter in Cell #0
      ]                       Loop till Cell #0 is zero; number of iterations is 8

      The result of this is:
      Cell No :   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
      Contents:   0   0  72 104  88  32   8
      Pointer :   ^

      >>.                     Cell #2 has value 72 which is 'H'
      >---.                   Subtract 3 from Cell #3 to get 101 which is 'e'
      +++++++..+++.           Likewise for 'llo' from Cell #3
      >>.                     Cell #5 is 32 for the space
      <-.                     Subtract 1 from Cell #4 for 87 to give a 'W'
      <.                      Cell #3 was set to 'o' from the end of 'Hello'
      +++.------.--------.    Cell #3 for 'rl' and 'd'
      >>+.                    Add 1 to Cell #5 gives us an exclamation point
      >++.                    And finally a newline from Cell #6
